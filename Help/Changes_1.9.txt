Apparel 1.9 changes:
1. Improved documentation inside SCSS stylesheets (table of contents for base.scss);
2. Removed color theme switcher from demo (html & js);
3. Changed gulp compile settings: now SCSS compiles to fully expanded CSS with comments.
4. Changed jQuery version from 2.2.0 to 1.12.0 (latest 1.x) for older browsers' support.
5. Moved jQuery from head to footer because it is no longer necessary in head.
6. All js libraries are now non-minified - even 3rd-party (vendor) ones! Minified versions are still there, in 'minified' folder.
